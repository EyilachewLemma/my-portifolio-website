An e-commerce website I made for Rensys Engineering. For Ethiopian farmers to store their perishable goods, Rensys Engineering plans to launch a cold room storage service. Additionally, Rensys Engineering intends to establish a market connection between wholesalers and farmers. And this is the reason they need an e-commerce platform.
